Introduction
============

Goal
----
The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

Deliverables
------------

There is a run_analysis.R script that performs the following transformation:
 
# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

There is this README.md which focuses on the details of how all works together.

There is a Codebook.md file that describes the experiential design, the raw data set, the transformation process and the resulting tidy data set.
